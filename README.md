- **Y-Axis:** Count of individuals in each category  
- **Bars:** Represent the total population per age group

## 🔎 Insights
- **Old Adults (~2,150)** form the **largest segment** of the dataset.  
- **Adults (~1,900)** are the **second-largest group**, showing strong representation.  
- **Young Adults (~370)** are significantly underrepresented compared to the other two groups.  

📌 **Key Takeaway:**  
- Businesses and marketers should prioritize strategies aimed at **old adults and adults**, as they make up the majority of the customer base.  
- The **young adult group is small** and may require **different engagement tactics** to attract and retain them.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Tableau / Excel** for visualization  
- **Bar chart** for categorical age analysis

## 📌 Next Steps
- Cross-analyze age groups with **spending habits** to identify which group contributes most to revenue.  
- Investigate why **young adults** are underrepresented — could it be affordability, preferences, or accessibility?  
- Segment further within each group (e.g., early adults vs. late adults) for deeper insights.
